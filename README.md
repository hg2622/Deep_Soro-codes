## Deep Soft Spherical Robot
The major code is still under development since the paper has not been published, and the real world experiment is still in progress.

Dataset: A sample dataset of the ball rolling off a terrain is provided. To visaulize it, 
1. Use animation tool such as Paraview
2. Open other/output.pvd
3. In Paraview, apply gravity before click start
4. Visualize the ball dropping
   
ResNetLSTM: To run this model, either modify the input of the model or use the provided MovingMNist dataset as input; if so, keep the epoch small to see the effect of hallucination method.
